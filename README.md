Abstract

Rodents function as important reservoir hosts for many infectious disease agents in
North America, particularly contributing to enzootic cycles of the Lyme disease 
pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). Rodent reservoir-targeted 
acaricide treatments aim to disrupt pathogen transmission between ticks and rodents
to reduce human tick-borne disease risk. In the western US, the efficacy of 
rodent-targeted topical acaricides to reduce B. burgdorferi s.s. infection prevalence 
in the primary tick vector, the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus), has been
understudied. We deployed rodent-targeted topical acaricides in Northern California
during peak larval and nymphal I. pacificus host-seeking activity from March - May
in 2023 and 2024, measuring B. burgdorferi s.s. infection prevalence in host-seeking
I. pacificus nymphs and rodent reservoir host species at three paired treatment and
control plots. Sampling began 20 days after acaricide bait station deployment each
year. A permethrin-based topical acaricide was tested at a one plot and a deltamethrin-based
acaricide at two plots. Mean rodent reservoir host infection prevalence declined from
10.3% in 2023 to 6.9% in 2024 post-treatment, though this reduction was not significant.
However, I. pacificus nymphal infection prevalence was significantly reduced in the 
permethrin-based treatment plot but significantly increased in deltamethrin-based treatment
plots in 2024. Rodent abundance and tick re-acquisition rates on recaptured rodents 
also differed significantly between treatment plots. These findings suggest that
permethrin and deltamethrin-based acaricides may differ in their effectiveness at 
preventing tick-borne pathogen transmission and that ecological factors, including
rodent host composition and species-specific efficacy, may influence treatment
outcomes.
